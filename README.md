# COSC4351_Project

**Description:**

A restaurant chain has reached out to your team to build a reservation
system.

**Here are the details:**

-   Two categories of users / customers: guest user or registered user.

-   Users should be able to search for a table and reserve.

    -   User doesn't need to login to the system to reserve a table. If
        registered users, they can login.

    -   User enters name, phone, email, date and time (date picker), and
        \# of guests for dining and system presents available tables.

    -   Tables have maximum capacity limit i.e., 2, 4, 6, or 8.

    -   Different combinations are allowed, and owner accommodates the
        seating, for example: someone requests 8 guests and table for 8
        is not available but 2 + 6, or 4+4 is available. System should
        combine the tables and notify owner they need to combine tables.
        In this case System reserves both tables.

-   If a guest user i.e., not a registered user, system should prompt
    user to register (Optional) before finalizing the reservation.

-   Registered users will have these fields:

    -   Name, mailing address, billing address (checkbox if same as
        mailing address), Preferred Diner \# (system generated), Earned
        points (based on \$ spent i.e., \$1 is 1 point), preferred
        payment method (cash, credit, check).

-   System should track high traffic days / weekends and a hold fee is
    required i.e. July 4^th^ will require valid credit card on system to
    reserve the table.

    -   Notify user no show will have minimum \$10 charge.

**Assumptions:**

If you make any assumptions to provide good user experience, please list
it.
